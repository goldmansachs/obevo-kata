<!--
The system-config-postgresql.xml file we use for this data will have comments indicating which fields you need and which you don't.

<!--
We start w/ the root dbSystemConfig element.

Required attributes:
* type - can be one of: DB2, SYBASE_ASE, SYBASE_IQ, H2, HSQL, POSTGRESQL, MSSQL, ORACLE

Notable optional attributes:
* autoReorgEnabled (defaults to true) - applicable for DB2 only. If true, we automatically execute the reorg statement if we detect that a table needs it. If false, we just print a warning message
* dataDelimiter (defaults to ,) - for the CSV static data files, this is the delimiter that is used
* nullToken (defaults to null) - for the CSV static data files, this is the string that indicates a null value in the database. (note - an empty string in the CSV would translate to an empty string in the DB)
-->
<dbSystemConfig type="HSQL">

    <!--
    Next - the schemas element. This is REQUIRED.
    This must contain at least 1 nested schema element
    -->
    <schemas>
        <!--
        The schema element only requires the name attribute that defines the "logical" name of your schema, as initially described on the wiki page
        By default, this would match the actual physical schema that would get deployed to in the database, but the dbEnvironment element
        below defines a couple of constructs to either append a suffix to the schema, or to override it completely

        There are optional subelements you can specify here in case you'd like to exclude any tables from getting cleaned up during the -cleanFirst command.
        However, this is a rare usecase, so I won't elaborate here. Please see the xsd for more information
        -->
        <schema name="DEMO_SCHEMA" />
    </schemas>


    <!--
    The groups and users elements are OPTIONAL
    Currently, Obevo does not use these elements for non-in-memory databases (e.g. DB2, SYBASE_ASE, SYBASE_IQ), as the assumption is that the
    DB server is already setup with this information

    However, we do use this for the in-memory databases (H2 and HSQL). This is used for when we define permissions using the <permissions> element
    (see the user guide and the <permissions> section below). Obevo will create these groups and users for H2/HSQL so that the permissions can
    get the executed.

    Note - if you would like to see this group/user creation feature enabled for the non-in-memory dbs, raise a JIRA request with your use case
    -->
    <groups>
        <group name="RO_GROUP1" />
        <group name="RW_GROUP" />
    </groups>
    <users>
        <!-- note - passwords are required for users. But this is only a password for the in-memory db. In any case, you should really
        be granting permissions on groups only, so ideally, you will not need this section -->
        <user name="SUPERUSER" password="mypass" />
    </users>


    <!--
    The environments element is REQUIRED
    This requires at least 1 dbEnvironment element under it
    -->
    <environments>
        <!-- dbEnvironment
        Required attributes:
        * name - logical name/alias for your environment. This name is used when you execute the deploy command and in the environment-specific include/exclude functionality
        * cleanBuildAllowed=whether the -cleanFirst param will be allowed. This is meant as a security check (i.e. so that you don't accidentally run this command against production)

        To define how to connect to your DB, you need one of the following sets of attributes:
        * Option 1: specify the JDBC URL
        ** jdbcUrl - the JDBC url that you would use to connect
        * Option 2: specify the host/port/url, and Obevo will create the url for you based on the typical format for that DBMS
        ** dbHost - the host name
        ** dbPort - the port number
        ** dbServer - the server name; only needed for some DBMS types such as DB2

        Optional attributes of note:
        * dbSchemaSuffix=ideally, in production, your actual schema names will be named as you have it above.
            But in dev/qa/uat, you may want to support multiple environments on a single server (esp. if you don't have multiple servers floating around)
            A convention to use is to append a suffix to each schema name to denote that environment. This property indicates that suffix
            The schemaOverrides element below relates to this
        * defaultUserId - the default id to use for logins if you prefer not to enter it in for each deployment for this environment, and if you are comfortable putting this in code
        * defaultPassword - the default password to use for logins if you prefer not to enter it in for each deployment for this environment, and if you are comfortable putting this in code
        * autoReorgEnabled - similar to the autoReorgEnabled attribute at the system level, except that we can override at an environment level if we choose
         -->
        <dbEnvironment name="test"
            cleanBuildAllowed="true"
            jdbcUrl="jdbc:hsqldb:hsql://localhost:9092/obevokata"
            dbSchemaSuffix="">
            <!--
            The includeSchemas/excludeSchemas elements can be used if:
            * You've define many <schema> elements above
            * And for some environments, you don't want to deploy all of them

            <includeSchemas>SCHEMA1,SCHEMA2</includeSchemas>
            or
            <excludeSchemas>SCHEMA1,SCHEMA2</excludeSchemas>
            -->

            <!--
            The schemaOverrides element lets you override the physical schema value for a particular schema
            The default is to do [logicalSchema]+[dbSchemaSuffix]
            But if for whatever reason you can't abide by this default, you can just override the value with a schemaOverride
            This is meant more for existing DBs that onboard to Obevo that can't change their schema names
            New dbs should look to adopt the [logicalSchema]+[dbSchemaSuffix] convention
            <schemaOverrides>
                <schemaOverride schema="SCHEMA1" overrideValue="MY_OVERRIDEN_SCHEMA" />
            </schemaOverrides>
            -->

            <!--
            Tokens are there in case you want to tokenize per environment. Just specify the token value in your sqls via ${key}
            The Kata files show the examples w/ the ${tableAStringFieldName} token - just do a search

            (note - you can choose to do your own tokenization external from Obevo. See the User Guide for more information
            -->
            <tokens>
                <token key="tableAStringFieldName" value="STRING_FIELD" />
                <token key="unusedToken" value="whatever" />
            </tokens>
        </dbEnvironment>
        <!--
        Another dbEnvironment if you choose ...
		<dbEnvironment name="test" type="DEV" cleanBuildAllowed="true" dbHost="myhost.me.com" dbPort="1234" dbServer="MYSERVER01" dbSchemaSuffix="_MYDEV1">
		</dbEnvironment>
